    <p>
      Understanding Our Users: To create an effective redesign of our registration software, we first needed to understand our users. Meet Jolly Jerry, a user persona who represents our target audience. Jolly Jerry's characteristics, behaviors, and pain points help us empathize with our users and design a solution that meets their needs.

      Empathizing with User Needs: Our empathy map helps us understand Jolly Jerry's thoughts, feelings, and pain points. By putting ourselves in his shoes, we can design a solution that addresses his specific needs and frustrations. This empathy map informs our design decisions and ensures that our solution is user-centered.

    <p>
      Designing Solutions: Using Figma, we created wireframe prototypes to visualize and test our design solutions. These prototypes allowed us to iterate and refine our design, ensuring that it meets user needs and is intuitive to use. Through cross-collaborative feedback and iteration, we are continually improving our design.

    <p>
      Collaborative Design Process: Our design process is highly collaborative, and we use tools like TRAC ticketing software to track bug fixes and feature requests. This thread shows the conversation and feedback from our team, which helps us refine our design and ensure that it meets user needs. We are committed to continuous improvement and iteration.
